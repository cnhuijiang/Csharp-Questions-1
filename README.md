# Csharp-Questions-1

1. A namespace is a collection of classes.
2. The value types contain data.
3. The reference types do not contain the actual data, but they reference a data
4. auto-implemented properties make property declaration more easily. Client can create objects under auto-implemented.
5. It include namespace. We can use other namespace which include class by using statement
6. Dynamic type means that you are not known the type until runtime. You can change that type.
7. Check if something is an object of one class.
8. It allow user to define classes and methods with placeholder. It can make you use the code twice or more time.
9. If you public a variable, you can use it in other class.
10. Public  void anything(params int[] list)
11. `Array.Sort(newarray);`
12. It’s an instance of the System.Nullable<T>. If you need to represent undefined value of an underlying type, you can use nullable type
13. Enumeration is a set of named integer constants
14. It can inherit some characteristic from parents class
15. yes
16. Cast without raising an exception if the cast fails.
17. Object type is an alias for  object in .NET.
18. Struct  is value type. Class is reference type
19. Continue: do next loop.  Break:stop loop
20. It refers to the current instance of the class.
21. Try do something. if exception occur, tell user. If you think exception will occur, you can use this.
22. If exception occur, you can tell user what’s the exception. 
23. finally keywords show something whatever exception occur.
24. Array can only store specific type of elements. Arraylist can store any type of elements.
25. It’s an instance of a class that is created dynamically
26. It’s a special method of the class. When you use a class, you will automatically use the constructor
27. When you want to give a value to variable, you can use var to automatically decide the type. It’s based on the given value
28. Abstract class is incomplete. You can use it in a derived class.
29. Other classes who use the interface must follow specific rule.
30. You can put value as parameter. And you will get different result based on method
31. Property is some value embedded in class.
32. It defines the scope of property or method.
33. Public: You can use the value in other class. Private: You can only use it in this class. 
34. Collection classes are kind of classes for data storage and retrieval
35. It’s a collection of key/value pairs which organized based on hash code of the key.
